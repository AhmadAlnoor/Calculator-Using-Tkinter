# Title: Calculator-Using-Tkinter
### Description : This repository consists of a simple calculator GUI that has been created using Python Tkinter. File found in the master branch

## Introduction:
The Simple Calculator GUI is created using Python Tkinter package. The GUI consists of:
1) A text field to show the user the numbers they've entered.
2) 17 buttons (digits from 0 - 9, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, a decimal number, equals sign, and a clear button to clear the text field of any numbers
The calculator GUI performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to get familiar with the basics of Tkinter widgets and to familiarize myself with Github (and gitbash).

## Details:
The "calculator.py" file can be found in the master branch. The file imports all of the tkinters libraries because this will save time importing individual libraries one at a time. Tkinter package should automatically be installed with Python.

Additional information on tkinter can be found here:

The Simple Calculator GUI consists of 3 main Tkinter widgets. 
1) The main window is where the other widgets will be placed. The main window is opened once the Python code is executed
2) The text field --> The text field is used to show the user which numbers the user has entered and to output a final result 
3) The Buttons    --> In this project the buttons have different functionality. The 0 - 9 buttons are used to visually output the numbers the user has entered into the text field. The arithmetic operator buttons are used to let the program know what operation the user wishes to perform. The equals button outputs the final result. Lastly, the clear button clears the text field

The GUI buttons have been made larger to provide extra space for the user to click the appropriate buttons. The GUI has also been made visually attractive by color coding the numbers. The arithmetic operation buttons have been colored grey. The equal sign is colored blue. The remaining buttons are white.
